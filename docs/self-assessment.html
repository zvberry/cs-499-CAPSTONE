    <h2>Reflection on Growth and Technical Development</h2>

    <p>
        Throughout the Computer Science program, I have developed not only technical proficiency but also the professional discipline required to design, evaluate, and deliver complete computing solutions. When I began this program, my focus was primarily on writing code that functioned correctly. Over time, I learned that professional software development extends far beyond functionality. It requires thoughtful architecture, efficiency, documentation, validation, scalability, and maintainability.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the area of software design and engineering, this capstone project allowed me to revisit my original Grazioso Salvare Animal Shelter application and improve its structure and clarity. I refactored logic, strengthened input validation, improved modularity, and enhanced overall readability. These improvements reflect my growth from writing basic functional scripts to designing structured, maintainable applications aligned with professional standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within algorithms and data structures, I analyzed how the application processed and handled data. I evaluated efficiency, simplified control flow where possible, and ensured that chosen structures supported clarity and scalability. This process demonstrated my ability to critically assess performance considerations rather than simply implementing solutions that work at a surface level.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the database enhancement, I strengthened CRUD operations and improved the application's interaction with MongoDB. I ensured queries were structured effectively, incorporated validation, and considered reliability when handling data operations. This enhancement reflects my understanding of backend systems, database design principles, and secure data management practices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond technical growth, this program strengthened my ability to troubleshoot complex deployment challenges, manage version control through GitHub, and present work in a polished and professional format. Building and deploying this GitHub Pages portfolio demonstrates my understanding of repository structure, documentation practices, and delivering work in an accessible and professional manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, this capstone represents the culmination of my development in problem-solving, system design, database integration, and professional communication. I am confident in my ability to design, develop, and deliver computing solutions that meet technical requirements while maintaining clarity, efficiency, and long-term maintainability.
